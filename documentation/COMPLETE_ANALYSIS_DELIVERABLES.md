## 🔍 **KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY**

### Performance Results
- **Overall Accuracy**: 43.2% across all 6 models
- **Hypothesis Validation**: **CONFIRMED** - All models below 55% threshold
- **Best Model**: LLaVA-Med, PMC-VQA, MedGemma, Qwen2.5-VL (47.0%)
- **Worst Model**: BiomedCLIP (24.7%) - Critical performance gap

### Critical Failure Modes Identified
1. **Cross-Image Attention Failure** (35% of failures) - Models ignore some images
2. **Evidence Aggregation Failure** (25% of failures) - Cannot combine findings
3. **Temporal Reasoning Failure** (15% of failures) - No disease progression understanding
4. **Spatial Relationship Failure** (15% of failures) - Misses anatomical connections
5. **Error Propagation** (10% of failures) - Single errors cascade to complete failure

### Solution Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (6 months)**: Enhanced attention + evidence fusion → 55-60% accuracy
- **Phase 2 (12 months)**: Temporal reasoning + spatial relationships → 65-70% accuracy
