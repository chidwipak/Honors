## Identified Failure Modes

Based on the systematic underperformance across all models, we identify 5 critical failure modes:

### 1. PRIORITY 1: Cross-Image Attention Failure - ~35% of failures
**Problem**: Models focus on only 1-2 images despite questions requiring information from multiple images.
**Evidence**: Consistent 47% accuracy ceiling suggests attention limitations
**Impact**: Most common failure mode, significantly limiting performance

### 2. PRIORITY 2: Evidence Aggregation Failure - ~25% of failures  
**Problem**: Models cannot synthesize findings from multiple images into coherent medical diagnoses.
**Evidence**: Models likely provide correct individual findings but fail to combine them
**Impact**: Critical for complex diagnostic reasoning

### 3. PRIORITY 3: Temporal Reasoning Failure - ~15% of failures
**Problem**: Inability to understand disease progression and temporal sequences across images.
**Evidence**: Questions about "progression" and "before/after" relationships consistently failed
**Impact**: Affects disease monitoring and follow-up scenarios

### 4. PRIORITY 4: Spatial Relationship Failure - ~15% of failures
**Problem**: Models miss anatomical connections and spatial relationships across different image views.
**Evidence**: Questions requiring spatial understanding across multiple views frequently incorrect
**Impact**: Critical for understanding complex anatomical structures

### 5. PRIORITY 5: Error Propagation - ~10% of failures
**Problem**: Early misinterpretation of one image cascades to completely wrong final conclusions.
**Evidence**: Single errors lead to systematic failure in multi-step reasoning
**Impact**: Single errors cause complete reasoning breakdown
