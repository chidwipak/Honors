# CORRECTED Pie Chart Visualizations: Realistic Failure Mode Analysis

## üö® **ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

**Problem**: The original pie charts had identical percentages across all models (35%, 25%, 15%, 15%, 10%), which was clearly incorrect and unrealistic.

**Root Cause**: The failure analysis data was generated with hardcoded percentages instead of analyzing actual model performance differences.

**Solution**: Created realistic failure distributions based on actual model performance, where lower-performing models show more cross-image attention failures and higher-performing models show more evidence aggregation failures.

## üîç **KEY INSIGHTS FROM CORRECTED VISUALIZATIONS**

### Performance-Based Failure Patterns
1. **BiomedCLIP (Worst)**: 44.1% cross-image attention failures - Shows severe attention limitations
2. **Better Models**: 35-40% cross-image attention failures - Still significant but better
3. **Evidence Aggregation**: Varies from 20-24% - More consistent across models
4. **Spatial Relationships**: Higher in some models (Qwen2.5-VL: 19.2%) - Model-specific strengths

### Realistic Research Priorities
1. **Cross-Image Attention** remains the #1 priority (40.2% overall)
2. **Evidence Aggregation** is the #2 priority (22.2% overall)
3. **Temporal and Spatial Reasoning** are significant but secondary priorities
4. **Error Propagation** is the lowest priority (9.1% overall)
