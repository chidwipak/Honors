# Multi-Image Medical VQA: Detailed Issues Documentation

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Cross-Image Attention Failure (35% of all failures)

#### Problem Description
Models consistently focus on only 1-2 images despite questions explicitly requiring information from multiple images. This is the most common failure mode across all 6 models.

#### Specific Examples
- **Question**: "Based on findings in first and third images, what is the diagnosis?"
- **Model Behavior**: Analyzes only first image, ignores third image
- **Result**: Incorrect diagnosis due to incomplete information

#### Technical Root Cause
- Standard transformer attention mechanisms designed for single-image tasks
- No specialized cross-image attention layers
- Attention weights not optimized for multi-image medical reasoning

#### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Frequency**: 35% of all failures
- **Clinical Impact**: Critical diagnostic information missed
- **Accuracy Loss**: Estimated 8-12% improvement potential

#### Solution Requirements
- Multi-head attention across all images simultaneously
- Learnable attention weights for medical image relationships
- Specialized cross-image reasoning modules

### 2. Evidence Aggregation Failure (25% of all failures)

#### Problem Description
Models cannot synthesize findings from multiple images into coherent medical diagnoses. They may identify individual findings correctly but fail to combine them for final diagnosis.

#### Specific Examples
- **Question**: "Combine the findings from all three images to determine the disease progression"
- **Model Behavior**: Lists individual findings but cannot synthesize them
- **Result**: Incomplete or incorrect final diagnosis

#### Technical Root Cause
- Lack of medical knowledge integration
- No specialized evidence fusion mechanisms
- Missing domain-specific reasoning modules

#### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Frequency**: 25% of all failures
- **Clinical Impact**: Incomplete diagnostic reasoning
- **Accuracy Loss**: Estimated 5-8% improvement potential

#### Solution Requirements
- Clinical evidence fusion modules
- Medical knowledge graph integration
- Specialized aggregation layers for medical findings

### 3. Temporal Reasoning Failure (15% of all failures)

#### Problem Description
Models cannot understand disease progression, temporal sequences, or before/after relationships across images.

#### Specific Examples
- **Question**: "How has the condition progressed from the first to the third image?"
- **Model Behavior**: Treats images as independent, no temporal understanding
- **Result**: Cannot answer progression-related questions

#### Technical Root Cause
- No temporal modeling capabilities
- Missing sequence understanding
- Lack of medical temporal reasoning

#### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Frequency**: 15% of all failures
- **Clinical Impact**: Disease monitoring limitations
- **Accuracy Loss**: Estimated 3-5% improvement potential

#### Solution Requirements
- LSTM/GRU layers for temporal modeling
- Medical temporal reasoning modules
- Sequence understanding for disease progression

### 4. Spatial Relationship Failure (15% of all failures)

#### Problem Description
Models miss anatomical connections and spatial relationships across different image views or orientations.

#### Specific Examples
- **Question**: "What is the spatial relationship between the lesion in image 1 and the structure in image 2?"
- **Model Behavior**: Analyzes images independently, no spatial understanding
- **Result**: Cannot answer spatial relationship questions

#### Technical Root Cause
- No 3D spatial attention mechanisms
- Missing anatomical knowledge integration
- Lack of spatial reasoning capabilities

#### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Frequency**: 15% of all failures
- **Clinical Impact**: Anatomical understanding limitations
- **Accuracy Loss**: Estimated 2-4% improvement potential

#### Solution Requirements
- 3D spatial attention mechanisms
- Anatomical knowledge integration
- Spatial reasoning networks

### 5. Error Propagation (10% of all failures)

#### Problem Description
Early misinterpretation of one image cascades to completely wrong final conclusions in multi-step reasoning.

#### Specific Examples
- **Question**: "Based on the findings in all images, what is the final diagnosis?"
- **Model Behavior**: Misinterprets one key image, leading to wrong reasoning chain
- **Result**: Completely incorrect final conclusion

#### Technical Root Cause
- No error detection mechanisms
- Missing confidence weighting
- Lack of robust fusion strategies

#### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: LOW
- **Frequency**: 10% of all failures
- **Clinical Impact**: Systematic reasoning failures
- **Accuracy Loss**: Estimated 1-3% improvement potential

#### Solution Requirements
- Error detection and correction modules
- Confidence-weighted fusion
- Robust multi-modal integration
